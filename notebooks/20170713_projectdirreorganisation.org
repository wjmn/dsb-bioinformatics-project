* Work Reorganisation

Up until now, all the work is recorded in the Jupyter notebooks predating this org file, as well as my own personal handwritten notes.

To ensure easier code manipulation and version control, I will be using a central org file (=makefile.org=) with code tangled into separate files within the =src= directory. I will continue to use dated notebooks to record details of my progress as I go. 

In addition, I will be updating the Google Drive document (https://docs.google.com/a/monash.edu/document/d/1F0qucM-XxRtRfOEErd22fEucy6gzrqXJUixhQG_D5oU/edit?usp=sharing) with details such as project progress and annotated readings.
